What is video?

    It is a sequence of images/frame arranged in a specific order.

How do we perform image classification?

    1. We take images
    2. User feature extractors (like CNN) to extract features from images.
    3. Classify that image based on these extracted features.

How do we perform video classification?

    1. We first extract frames from the given video
    2. Then we use feature extractors (line CNNs) to extract features from all the frames
    3. Then classify every frame based on these extracted features
